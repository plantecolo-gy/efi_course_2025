## What is a dynamic model? {.smaller}

. . .

Dynamic models describe a function implicitly by describing the *change* that governs it.

Differential equations in continuous time

- "differential equation": an equation containing an unknown function and its derivative(s), e.g.
  
-
$$
\frac{dN}{dt} = rN \hspace{5pt} \text{ or } \hspace{5pt} \frac{1}{N}\frac{dN}{dt} = r,
$$
for constant $r$.

- "solving" differential equations means finding the unknown function analytically or numerically, e.g.
  $$
   N(t) = N_0e^{rt} \hspace{10pt} \text{ for } t \geq 0
  $$

Difference equations in discrete time

- "difference equation": specifies a function at $t+1$ in terms of value at $t$ 
- e.g. 
  $$
  N_{t+1} = N_t + rN_t = (1 + r)N_t
  $$
- or generally
$$
N_{t+1} = F(N_t)
$$
for some function $F$

- numerical simulation of difference equations is straightforward

## Population growth {.smaller}

Two classic dynamic models describe different population dynamics

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

- Exponential growth 
$$
\frac{dN}{dt} = rN.
$$


- Logistics population model with density-dependent dynamics
$$
\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\left(1 - \frac{N}{K}\right),
$$

. . .

Per-capita rate of change $\frac{1}{N}\frac{dN}{dt}$ is very simple in both, but dynamics are highly non-linear.


# Intuition building

## Dynamic models in discrete time {.smaller}

Let's start at the simplest possible dynamic models in discrete time


$$
y_{t+1} = y_t 
$$

. . .

The only thing the dynamics depend on is the initial condition $y_1$:

. . .

## Dynamic models in discrete time {.smaller}

As an aside, things get a bit more interesting if we move from a deterministic to a stochastic model


$$
y_{t+1} = y_t + \epsilon_t, \hspace{10pt} \text{ where } \epsilon_t \sim \text{Normal}(0, \sigma^2)
$$

. . .

The result is known as a random walk:

## Dynamic models in discrete time {.smaller }

Back to deterministic models, exponential growth/decline results from

. . .

$$
y_{t+1} = \rho y_t \hspace{5pt} \text{ for } \rho > 0.
$$

:::: {.columns}


::: {.column width="50%" .incremental}
- Solve by iteration, 
  - $y_2 = \rho y_1$, 
  - $y_3 = \rho y_2 = \rho^2 y_1$,
  - ...
- So $$y_{t+1} = \rho^t y_1,$$ thus exponential growth ($\rho > 1$) or decline ($\rho < 1$).

## Dynamic models in discrete time {.smaller }

Consider something slightly more complex:

$$
y_{t+1} = \beta + \rho y_t.
$$

. . .
 
How can we understand this equation?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%" .incremental}
- if $\beta > 0$ and $\rho > 1$, exponential growth
- long-run behaviour and equilibria
  - if $\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty}y_t = l$ exists, $l = \beta/(1-\rho)$
  - alternatively, subtract $y_t$ from both sides to get
  $$ \Delta y_t = y_{t+1} - y_t = \beta + (\rho - 1) y_t $$
  - equilibrium if $\Delta y_t=0$, at $l = \beta/(1-\rho)$
- the equilibrium is only sensible if $\beta > 0$ and $0 < \rho < 1$.

If we push things just one bit further, all hell breaks loose! 

::: {.incremental}

- exponential growth: $y_{t+1} = \rho y_t$ where $\rho = y_{t+1}/y_t$ is the *growth rate*

- for density dependence, 

  - $\rho = \rho(y_t)$, for example $\rho(y_t) = r\left(1 - \frac{y_t}{K}\right)$

  - $$
\rho(y_t) \approx \left\{
  \begin{align}
  r & \hspace{5pt} \mbox{ if } y_t << K \\
  0 & \hspace{5pt} \mbox{ if } y_t \approx K.
  \end{align} \right.
$$

- we arrive at a non-linear equation
$$
y_{t+1} = ry_t\left(1 - \frac{y_t}{K}\right)
$$

- we can remove $K$ by scaling, $x_t = y_t/K$, giving one parameter
$$
x_{t+1} = rx_t(1-x_t)
$$

The 'logistic map' $x_{t+1} = rx_t(1-x_t)$ has incredibly rich dynamics as $r$ varies! The dynamics at various value of $r$ are explored in the interactive `logistic_map` app, which you can run from `run_apps.R`.
