# Projections and Decision Support {background-color="#33431e"}

Jasper Slingsby


## Decision Support {background-color="#33431e"}

<br/>

Probably the hardest part of the whole ecological forecasting business... people!

<br/>

It is also a huge topic. Here I just touch on a few hints and difficulties.


## Decision Support {background-color="#33431e"}

<br/>

First and foremost, ***the decision at hand may not be amenable to a quantitative approach***.

  - Ecological forecasting requires a ***clearly defined*** information need with ***measurable*** (and modelable) state variables, framed within one or multiple ***decision alternatives*** (scenarios). 

## Decision Support {background-color="#33431e"}

<br/>

Secondly, there's also the risk of ***external factors making the forecasts unreliable***, especially if they are not controlled by the decision maker and/or their probability is unknown (e.g. fire, pandemics, etc). 


## Decision Support {.smaller background-color="#33431e"}

One way to try to deal with external factors is by developing ***scenarios with different boundary conditions***.

<br>

  - e.g. scenarios with and without a fire, or different future climate states under alternative development pathways, etc. 
  - Scenarios are often *"what if"* statements designed to address major sources of uncertainty that make it near-impossible to make accurate predictions with a single forecast.

> A reminder of the distinction between ***predictions _versus_ projections***:

>  - _***predictions*** are statements about the probability of the occurrence of events or the state of variables in the future ***based on what we currently know***_
>  - _***projections*** are statements about the probability of the occurrence of events or the state of variables in the future ***given specific scenarios with clear boundary conditions***_

### In an ideal world...

You'll be working with an organized team that is a well-oiled machine at implementing ***Adaptive Management*** and ***Structured Decision Making*** and you can naturally slot into their workflow.

<br>

The advantages of ***Adaptive Management*** and ***Structured Decision Making*** are that they are founded on the concept of ***iterative learning cycles***, which they have in common with the ecological forecasting cycle and the scientific method.

```{r dietze2018F1b, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Conceptual relationships between iterative ecological forecasting, adaptive decision-making, adaptive monitoring, and the scientific method cycles [@Dietze2018].", fig.width=4, fig.align = 'center', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/dietze2018_F1.jpg")
```

<br>

The iterative ecological forecast cycle integrates nicely with Adaptive Management...

Focused on the process of ***coming to a decision***, not the process of management, but very useful in the first iteration of the Adaptive Management Cycle.

Could easily be the topic of a whole course in itself, e.g. this [online course by the US Fish and Wildlife Service](https://www.fws.gov/training/ALC3183-an-overview-of-structured-decision-making).

It is valuable when there are many stakeholders with ***disparate interests***. 

::: {.fragment}

  - ***decisions are ultimately about values*** and often require evaluating trade-offs among properties with ***incomparable units*** - e.g. people housed/fed/watered vs species saved from extinction... 
  - this can be a highly emotive space, and greatly benefits from a structured facilitation process

<br/>

It tries to bring ***all issues and values to light*** to be considered in a transparent framework where trade-offs can be identified and considered.

  - You can't make the right choice if it isn't on the table...
  - Step 0 is just identifying the necessary stakeholders (and getting them to the table).

It ***directly addresses the social, political or cognitive biases*** that marginalise some values or alternatives. 

::: {.fragment}

- Many decisions pit people's immediate needs (water, housing, etc) against the environment. We'd rather ignore that choosing one is choosing against the other, but ***if we're not transparent about this we're not going to learn from our decisions and improve them in the next iteration.***

But...

::: {.fragment}

- Very tricky to do well and easy to do badly...
- Requires a good, well-trained facilitator who understands stakeholder and researcher needs
- Needs trust and buy-in from participants
- Can take a lot of time to get right...
- Often simplifies a problem so that it is feasible to analyse

## Ideal world? (see slide 7) {.smaller background-color="#33431e"}

<br/>

The beauty for the forecaster in this scenario is that **a lot of the work is already done**. 

::: {.incremental}

- The decision alternatives (scenarios) have been well framed.
- The performance measures, state variables of interest and associated covariates mostly identified. 
- Iterations of the learning cycle may even have already begun (through the Adaptive Management Cycle) and all you need do is ***develop the existing qualitative model into something more quantitative*** as more data and understanding are accumulated.

Can focus on estimating (forecasting) consequences and evaluating trade-offs among alternatives (steps 4 and 5), rather than having to do the whole process from scratch.

::: {.column width="40%"}

<br/>

Often one has to forecast multiple state variables, which may or may not be related to each other.

<br/>

Decision-makers may also have to consider trade-offs among qualitative as well as quantitative consequences under different decision scenarios.

## Uncertainty? {.smaller background-color="#33431e"}

::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}

### Model

Quantify and propagate uncertainty!

> _"It is better to be uncertain and right than confidently wrong."_

Sensitivity analysis:

- How robust is the decision to uncertainty in the model and assumptions?

- How wrong does your model have to be before the decision changes?


:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

### Communication

- Communicate uncertainty in the model and forecasts clearly to decision-makers.

- Be transparent about the limitations of the model and the assumptions made.

- Use uncertainty visualizations to help decision-makers understand the range of possible outcomes.

- Frame uncertainty in multiple ways - e.g. 5% vs 1 in 20
